# yggdrasil-keys-rs

yggdrasil-keys-rs is a rust library for handling yggdrasil keys. It's written in pure rust, using the ed25519 and curve25519 implementations from dalek.rs.

## Usage

The documentation on this is a bit lacking right now, as this is still quite WIP.
There are some examples available in the tests.
