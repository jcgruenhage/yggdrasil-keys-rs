//! yggdrasil-keys
//!
//! Pure rust implementation of a subset of the key handling duties for
//! the yggdrasil mesh network.
//!
//! This crate implements:
//!  - (de)serializing keys into hex Strings
//!  - generating new keys
//!  - calculating Node and Tree IDs
//!  - converting Node IDs into IPv6 addresses and subnets
